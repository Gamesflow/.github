First time participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)?

Well, I have got a solution for all the newbie web devs out there.

If you are having a problem in searching for repos to contribute to, then read this till the end.

I present before you [Gamesflow](https://github.com/Gamesflow)
Gamesflow is a combination of 5 web browser based games built on HTML, CSS and Javascript

This org account contains 5 repositories divided on the basis of level of advancement.

## Beginners
For beginner repos, the HTML-CSS-JS code is based in one html file.

### Repo 1. [2048 game](https://two0four8.onrender.com)

This repo is for a fun and animated version of the OG 2048 game. It is a game where you add numbers of similar values to reach the number 2048. So, this is a good place to start.
